        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <article>
            <p>With the rapid proliferation of vehicle availability and usage in recent years, finding a vacant car parking space is becoming more and more difficult, resulting in a number of practical conflicts. Parking problems are becoming ubiquitous and ever growing at an alarming rate in every major city. Lot of research and development is being done all over the world to implement better and smarter parking management mechanisms. Most vehicle users have resorted to parking their vehicles on the road side which has led to congestion in most cities and some streets might end up being impassable until the vehicles have been removed. Location of empty slots for parking by vehicle users has been a major concern in the cities especially to visitors in the city.</p>
            <p>The system will be designed to minimize the area and/or volume required for parking cars. It will be designed for optimum utilization of parking space by utilizing vertical space rather than horizontal space by providing parking for cars on multiple levels stacked vertically to maximize the number of parking spaces while minimizing land usage. Car is driven up to the entry point of the automated storey parking system and the driver and passengers exit the car. The car is then moved automatically to its parking space. The project when implemented will be designed to occupy the basement of storey buildings while they are under construction so as to be included in the design of the building. In already existing buildings the structure will be able to be implemented on the already existing parking lots while maximizing the available space. The project when implemented will enable vehicle users to check the available parking. The project intends to use ultrasonic sensors to automate the parking and a microcontroller through stepper motor will use chain and sprocket mechanism is used for driving the parking platform.</p>
            <p>When implemented the project aims to develop automated car parking system with a minimum cost for reducing congestion within the cities to help ease of movement of motorists within a city. The project when implemented will help the vehicle users to easily locate the available parking lots to avoid being stranded while trying to locate an empty parking space. This in the end will result in the reduction of wastage of time and fuel finding free space around the parking ground.</p>
